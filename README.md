## Background

There are several global objects such as `TextEncoder` and `crypto` that are
present in Node.js and most browsers, but not in React Native.

This is a polyfill for these objects, which exports the following globals:

* `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder`
* `crypto` and `crypto.subtle` (WebCryptography API)

## Install

- Node.js 20+ is recommended.

### NPM

To install via NPM:

```
npm install @digitalcredentials/data-integrity-rn
```

### Development

To install locally (for development):

```
git clone https://github.com/digitalcredentials/data-integrity-rn.git
cd data-integrity-rn
npm install
```

## Usage

When developing for React Native and using various DCC-provided libraries such
as [`@digitalcredentials/vc`](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/vc),
make sure to import this polyfill before importing the DCC libraries:

```js
import '@digitalcredentials/data-integrity-rn'
// Now you can import various libraries
import '@digitalcredentials/vc'
// ...
```
